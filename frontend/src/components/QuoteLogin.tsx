                    "To laugh often and much: To win the respect of intelligent people
                     and the affection of children, to earn the appreciation of honest
                    critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate
                    beauty, to find the best in others, to leave the world a bit better
                    whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social
                    condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you
                    lived. This is to have succeeded."
